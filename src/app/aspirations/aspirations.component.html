  <h4>The road is long...</h4>
  <p>To become an excellent software developer takes ages. Hell, even becoming a mediocre one takes a long, long time. 
  Yet, my aim is to keep learning new things and gradually improve upon my professional skills as a developer. I'm interested in both
  back-end and front-end development. Though as it now stands, front-end development seems more appealing to me. Angular 2, on which this
  website is built, seems fascinating and I'd like to keep studying it.</p>
  <p>As I'm in the home stretch of my studies, it's time to start thinking about my future employment. Hopefully it'll be at a company
  that provides a young developer such as myself with a nurturing, facilitating environment with room to breathe yet with
  challenging tasks. Somewhere where the working environment is multicultural; English and Swedish have always been two
  of my favourite subjects at school, so putting those skills to practice would be great. </p>
