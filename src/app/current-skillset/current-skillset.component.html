    <section><h5>Honorable mentions</h5>
    <p>I have some experience with a couple of CSS libraries, including Bootstrap, Foundation 6 and Materialize.css. And in the above mentioned
    Spring project we used Maven to manage dependencies, so there's that, too. I recognize JSON syntax, have used AJAX 
    succesfully a couple of times. Used SASS a couple of times. The images on this website where created/edited with
    paint.net. Photo editing is really not my game, though.</p>
