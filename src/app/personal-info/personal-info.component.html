<strong>Employment history</strong>

<strong>Recreational interests</strong>
<p>I used to like reading books written in Swedish or English (still do, but finding time for it has become
rather difficult). I played football for ten years, ten years ago. Nowadays I play floorball once a week. I enjoy taking long
walks with our dog, Dahlia. Playing videogames has been close to my heart ever since I was a kid (I own a PS4). Picking up and 
dropping off my lovely wife to work has become a daily routine. I also enjoy traveling and have been to quite a few countries in Europe and
a few overseas. </p>
